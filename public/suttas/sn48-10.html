                            <p>
I've been having trouble concentrating this week, so I decided to revisit the suttas. The concept of metacognition, or thinking about thinking, stood out to me while scanning the section on concentration in the Dutiyavibhaṅgasutta (SN 48.10). The text tells us that finding joy in deep concentration is a step towards what Bhikkhu Sujato translates as full "immersion". Yet as long as we're analyzing how we focus, we're not really present.
</p>

<p>
I think Bhikkhu Sujato's choice of the word "immersion" is fitting. We can't just dip a toe in concentration — we need to fully dive in. As we submerge ourselves in the waters of the present moment, there is no room for the hot air of our egos and opinions. There is no more pleasure or pain swirling around us, just cool, deep equanimity.
</p>

<p>
I found this idea so powerful because it made me recognize all the times I stopped short of a real "flow state". Even when I'm the most productive, I'm either filled with pride or desperately trying to get the job over with. The ego is always there, standing in the way of pure mindfulness.
</p>

<p>
This also connects to the idea of practicing just to practice. I often meditate to feel better, but that shouldn't be the goal. Chasing after peace and running from discomfort is all clinging. If we're doing something just to feel good or get it over with, we're not present.
</p>

<p>
I read a line by Thich Nhat Hanh yesterday that said something like, "washing this dish is the most important job in the world." Every task should be approached that way. Surgeons and bomb squads aren't concentrating if they're thinking about how they're thinking.
</p>

<p>
Their only job is the present moment. Make it yours also.

                                        <p>The “Linked” or “Connected” Discourses (Saṁyutta Nikāya, abbreviated SN) is a collection of over a thousand short discourses in the Pali canon. The word “linked” refers to the fact that the texts are collected and organized by topic. In most cases the organizing principle is a particular theme of Dhamma, for example, the five aggregates, dependent origination, the noble eightfold path, mindfulness meditation, or the four noble truths. This collection contains the most extensive range of texts on these core themes. In other cases chapters are organized according to the person or kind of person who speaks. This collection has a full parallel in the Saṁyuktāgama (SA) of the Sarvāstivāda school in Chinese translation. In addition, there are two partial collections in Chinese (SA-2 and SA-3) as well as a number of miscellaneous or fragmentary texts in Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan. Much of the organizational structure of SN is shared with SA, suggesting that this structure preceded the split between these two collections.</p>

This book is the primary source for these teachings. Subsequent <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṁyuttas</i> deal with the path from different perspectives, while the final two deal with stream-entry and the four noble truths respectively.</p>

The “five faculties” of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom are the most natural fit in this context. However the chapter also finds room for discourses on a wider range of 22 faculties, including the six sense faculties, five affective faculties (kinds of feeling), three faculties relating the process of enlightenment, and three concerning biology and gender. This flexible category thus serves as a link between the teachings on wisdom and those on the path.</p>
