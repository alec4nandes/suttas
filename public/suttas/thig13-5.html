                    <p>Verses of the Elder Bhikkhunīs </p>
                
                    <p>Chapter of the Twenties </p>
                
                    <p>Subhā, the Daughter of a Blacksmith </p>
                
                    <p>“I was young and pure </p>
                
                    <p>when I heard the Dhamma. </p>
                
                    <p>I understood the truth </p>
                
                    <p>through heedfulness, </p>
                
                    <p>and then all sensual pleasures </p>
                
                    <p>stopped being so appealing. </p>
                
                    <p>I saw the danger in self-identity </p>
                
                    <p>and longed for renunciation. </p>
                
                    <p>I left behind relatives, </p>
                
                    <p>workers and servants, </p>
                
                    <p>and prosperous village fields, </p>
                
                    <p>pleasing and delightful. </p>
                
                    <p>I gave up much wealth </p>
                
                    <p>for the sake of going forth, </p>
                
                    <p>Now that I have left the household life </p>
                
                    <p>out of faith in the well-spoken true Dhamma, </p>
                
                    <p>it wouldn’t be proper </p>
                
                    <p>for one who aspires to nothingness, </p>
                
                    <p>to revert to gold and silver </p>
                
                    <p>after casting them away. </p>
                
                    <p>Silver or gold </p>
                
                    <p>do not bring enlightenment nor peace. </p>
                
                    <p>They are not proper for a contemplative, </p>
                
                    <p>this isn’t noble wealth. </p>
                
                    <p>It’s just greed and intoxication, </p>
                
                    <p>delusion and increase of impurity. </p>
                
                    <p>It is unreliable, troublesome, </p>
                
                    <p>and short-lived. </p>
                
                    <p>Human beings with defiled minds pursue it. </p>
                
                    <p>Heedless and lustful, </p>
                
                    <p>they get into numerous quarrels, </p>
                
                    <p>pitting themselves against each other. </p>
                
                    <p>One can see those entangled in sensual pleasures </p>
                
                    <p>afflicted with much misfortune: </p>
                
                    <p>ruin, imprisonment, hardship, </p>
                
                    <p>loss, grief, and lamentation. </p>
                
                    <p>Treacherous relatives, </p>
                
                    <p>why do you try to trap me in sensual pleasures? </p>
                
                    <p>You know I have gone forth </p>
                
                    <p>after seeing the danger in sensual pleasures. </p>
                
                    <p>Neither gold nor money </p>
                
                    <p>will eliminate the influences of mind. </p>
                
                    <p>Sensual pleasures are murderous enemies, </p>
                
                    <p>foes, darts, fetters. </p>
                
                    <p>Treacherous relatives, </p>
                
                    <p>why do you try to trap me in sensual pleasures? </p>
                
                    <p>You know I have gone forth </p>
                
                    <p>with a shaven head, wrapped in the outer robe. </p>
                
                    <p>Collecting lumps of leftover food, </p>
                
                    <p>and robes made from discarded rags: </p>
                
                    <p>these are the supports for the homeless life, </p>
                
                    <p>this is what is proper for me. </p>
                
                    <p>The great sages have spewed out sensual pleasures, </p>
                
                    <p>both divine and human. </p>
                
                    <p>They are in a safe place, they are liberated, </p>
                
                    <p>they have reached unshakable happiness. </p>
                
                    <p>I should not get involved with sensual pleasures, </p>
                
                    <p>where safety is not found. </p>
                
                    <p>Sensual pleasures are deadly enemies, </p>
                
                    <p>they are like a great mass of fire, they are suffering. </p>
                
                    <p>Greed is hazardous, frightful, </p>
                
                    <p>pestering, troublesome. </p>
                
                    <p>It is the opposite of peace, </p>
                
                    <p>and the way into much delusion. </p>
                
                    <p>Sensual pleasures are like the head of a snake, </p>
                
                    <p>dangerous and dire. </p>
                
                    <p>Foolish blind worldlings </p>
                
                    <p>delight in them—</p>
                
                    <p>indeed there are many foolish beings in the world, </p>
                
                    <p>trapped in the mud of sensual pleasures, </p>
                
                    <p>who do not know the end </p>
                
                    <p>of birth and death. </p>
                
                    <p>Because of sensual pleasures </p>
                
                    <p>humans are on the path that leads to a bad destination. </p>
                
                    <p>Many decide to follow it, </p>
                
                    <p>bringing illness to themselves, </p>
                
                    <p>by producing enmity, </p>
                
                    <p>torment, and complete defilement. </p>
                
                    <p>Sensual pleasures are entrapping, </p>
                
                    <p>the world’s bait that binds us to death. </p>
                
                    <p>Maddening, enticing, </p>
                
                    <p>sensual pleasures crush the mind. </p>
                
                    <p>They are a trap set by Māra </p>
                
                    <p>for the defilement of sentient beings. </p>
                
                    <p>Sensual pleasures have endless drawbacks, </p>
                
                    <p>cause much suffering, and are highly poisonous. </p>
                
                    <p>They bring little enjoyment, they produce conflict, </p>
                
                    <p>causing one’s bright wholesome traits to wither away. </p>
                
                    <p>I will not go back </p>
                
                    <p>to sensual pleasures, </p>
                
                    <p>which have caused me so much misery—</p>
                
                    <p>now I always enjoy Nirvana. </p>
                
                    <p>When I was battling with sensual pleasures, </p>
                
                    <p>I longed for a state of coolness—</p>
                
                    <p>now I dwell heedful </p>
                
                    <p>in the destruction of all fetters. </p>
                
                    <p>Free from sorrow, stainless, safe: </p>
                
                    <p>I follow the upright </p>
                
                    <p>Noble Eightfold Path, </p>
                
                    <p>the one because of which the Great Sage crossed over.” </p>
                
                    <p>“You see this person established in Dhamma, </p>
                
                    <p>Subhā, the daughter of a blacksmith. </p>
                
                    <p>Having become free from passion, </p>
                
                    <p>she meditates at the root of a tree. </p>
                
                    <p>Today is the eighth day since her going forth, </p>
                
                    <p>faith shining in the true Dhamma. </p>
                
                    <p>Trained by Uppalavaṇṇā, </p>
                
                    <p>possessing the three knowledges, leaving behind death. </p>
                
                    <p>A free person with no debt, </p>
                
                    <p>a bhikkhunī with well-developed spiritual powers, </p>
                
                    <p>with all bonds unbound, </p>
                
                    <p>she is one who has done what was to be done, and is free from influences.” </p>
                
                    <p>Then Sakka, using psychic powers, </p>
                
                    <p>approached her with an assembly of Devas, </p>
                
                    <p>and the lord of beings paid homage to </p>
                
                    <p>Subhā, the daughter of a blacksmith. </p>
                
                    <p>… The Elder Subhā, daughter of a blacksmith. </p>
                
                    <p>The Chapter of the Twenties is finished. </p>
