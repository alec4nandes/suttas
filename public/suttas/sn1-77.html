                                        <p>The “Linked” or “Connected” Discourses (Saṁyutta Nikāya, abbreviated SN) is a collection of over a thousand short discourses in the Pali canon. The word “linked” refers to the fact that the texts are collected and organized by topic. In most cases the organizing principle is a particular theme of Dhamma, for example, the five aggregates, dependent origination, the noble eightfold path, mindfulness meditation, or the four noble truths. This collection contains the most extensive range of texts on these core themes. In other cases chapters are organized according to the person or kind of person who speaks. This collection has a full parallel in the Saṁyuktāgama (SA) of the Sarvāstivāda school in Chinese translation. In addition, there are two partial collections in Chinese (SA-2 and SA-3) as well as a number of miscellaneous or fragmentary texts in Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan. Much of the organizational structure of SN is shared with SA, suggesting that this structure preceded the split between these two collections.</p>

                                        <p>The “Book With Verses” is the first of the five books of the Linked Discourses. It is divided into eleven <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṁyuttas</i> or “sections”, with a total of 271 suttas. Most of these are further subdivided into <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vaggas</i> of ten suttas. The word <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vagga</i> is thus used of both the major overarching “book” and the subsidiary “chapter”. Each of the suttas in this collection contains verse with a prose narrative structure, although in many cases the prose has been omitted through abbreviation. Where most of the Saṁyutta is organized around subject matter, here the organizational principle is people. Each <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṁyutta</i> contains conversation involving the Buddha or his disciples with a different person or kind of person, such as gods, kings, nuns, or brahmins. A typical sutta has a bare narrative framework, where someone comes to the Buddha and utters a verse, and the Buddha replies with a better one. In some cases, notably the Sakkasaṁyutta, the narrative element is developed into a lively exchange. Some of the texts in this collection are well known and widely quoted, such as the invitation of Brahmā or the nun Vajirā’s simile of the person as a chariot. Most of the suttas here have parallels in the Chinese Saṁyuktāgama translations; the partial translations SA 2 and SA 3 include Sagāthāvagga material. In addition, many of the verses have parallels elsewhere throughout the Buddhist literature in all languages.</p>

                                        <p>The “Linked Discourses on Deities” contains 81 discourses, each one of which depicts the Buddha in conversation with a deity. Typically a deity approaches the Buddha in the monastery at Sāvatthī, illuminating the night with their glory. The deity addresses the Buddha with a question or verse, which may be a praise, a challenge, a riddle, or simply a reflection. The Buddha responds, usually elevating the discourse to a higher plane. As always in Buddhist texts, a deity is not worshiped, but is regarded as a temporary rebirth in a higher plane; the deities learn from the Buddha, not the other way around. In most cases, the narrative framework is slim, and after a while it is dropped entirely, retaining just the verses. There’s no particular theme to the discourses, which range from the simple to the profound.</p>
