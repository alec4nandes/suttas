                    <p>Long Discourses 1 </p>
                
                    <p>The Divine Net </p>
                
                    <p>1. Talk on Wanderers </p>
                
                    <p>So I have heard. </p>
                
                    <p>At one time the Buddha was traveling along the road between Rājagaha and Nāḷandā together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants. </p>
                
                    <p>The wanderer Suppiya was also traveling along the same road, together with his pupil, the brahmin student Brahmadatta. </p>
                
                    <p>Meanwhile, Suppiya criticized the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways, </p>
                
                    <p>but his pupil Brahmadatta praised them in many ways. </p>
                
                    <p>And so both teacher and pupil followed behind the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants directly contradicting each other. </p>
                
                    <p>Then the Buddha took up residence for the night in the royal rest-house in Ambalaṭṭhikā together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. </p>
                
                    <p>And Suppiya and Brahmadatta did likewise. </p>
                
                    <p>There too, Suppiya criticized the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways, </p>
                
                    <p>but his pupil Brahmadatta praised them in many ways. </p>
                
                    <p>And so both teacher and pupil kept on directly contradicting each other. </p>
                
                    <p>Then several mendicants rose at the crack of dawn and sat together in the pavilion, where the topic of judgmentalism came up: </p>
                
                    <p>“It’s incredible, reverends, it’s amazing how the diverse convictions of sentient beings have been clearly comprehended by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. </p>
                
                    <p>For this Suppiya criticizes the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways, </p>
                
                    <p>while his pupil Brahmadatta praises them in many ways. </p>
                
                    <p>And so both teacher and pupil followed behind the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants directly contradicting each other.” </p>
                
                    <p>When the Buddha found out about this discussion on judgmentalism among the mendicants, he went to the pavilion, where he sat on the seat spread out and addressed the mendicants, </p>
                
                    <p>“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?” </p>
                
                    <p>The mendicants told him what had happened, adding, </p>
                
                    <p>“This was our conversation that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived.” </p>
                
                    <p>“Mendicants, if others criticize me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, don’t make yourselves resentful, bitter, and exasperated. </p>
                
                    <p>You’ll get angry and upset, which would be an obstacle for you alone. </p>
                
                    <p>If others were to criticize me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, and you got angry and upset, would you be able to understand whether they spoke well or poorly?” </p>
                
                    <p>“No, sir.” </p>
                
                    <p>“If others criticize me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, you should explain that what is untrue is in fact untrue: </p>
                
                    <p>‘This is why that’s untrue, this is why that’s false. There’s no such thing in us, it’s not found among us.’ </p>
                
                    <p>If others praise me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, don’t make yourselves thrilled, elated, and excited. </p>
                
                    <p>You’ll get thrilled, elated, and excited, which would be an obstacle for you alone. </p>
                
                    <p>If others praise me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, you should acknowledge that what is true is in fact true: </p>
                
                    <p>‘This is why that’s true, this is why that’s correct. There is such a thing in us, it is found among us.’ </p>
                
                    <p>2. Ethics </p>
                
                    <p>2.1. The Shorter Section on Ethics </p>
                
                    <p>When an ordinary person speaks praise of the Realized One, they speak only of trivial, insignificant details of mere ethics. </p>

                    <p>‘The ascetic Gotama has given up divisive speech. He doesn’t repeat in one place what he heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, he reconciles those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.’ </p>
                
                    <p>Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One. </p>

                    <p>There are other principles—deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute—which the Realized One makes known after realizing them with his own insight. Those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. </p>
                
                    <p>And what are these principles? </p>
                
                    <p>There are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past, and assert various hypotheses concerning the past on eighteen grounds. </p>
                
                    <p>And what are the eighteen grounds on which they rely? </p>
                
                    <p>3.1.1. Eternalism </p>
                
                    <p>There are some ascetics and brahmins who are eternalists, who assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal on four grounds. </p>
                
                    <p>And what are the four grounds on which they rely? </p>
                
                    <p>It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right application of mind—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect their many kinds of past lives. </p>
                
                    <p>That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. </p>
                
                    <p>They say: </p>
                
                    <p>‘The self and the cosmos are eternal, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. </p>
                
                    <p>They remain the same for all eternity, while these sentient beings wander and transmigrate and pass away and rearise. </p>
                
                    <p>Why is that? </p>
                
                    <p>Because by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right application of mind I experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that I recollect my many kinds of past lives, </p>
                
                    <p>with features and details. </p>

                    <p>They remain the same for all eternity, while these sentient beings wander and transmigrate and pass away and rearise.”’ </p>
                
                    <p>This is the first ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal. </p>

                    <p>That is: one eon of the cosmos contracting and expanding; two, three, four, five, or ten eons of the cosmos contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended.

                    <p>And what is the fourth ground on which they rely? </p>
                
                    <p>It’s when some ascetic or brahmin relies on logic and inquiry. They speak of what they have worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing their own perspective: </p>
                
                    <p>‘The self and the cosmos are eternal, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. </p>

                    <p>This is the fourth ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal. </p>
                
                    <p>These are the four grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal. </p>
                
                    <p>Any ascetics and brahmins who assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal do so on one or other of these four grounds. Outside of this there is none. </p>
                
                    <p>The Realized One understands this: </p>
                
                    <p>‘If you hold on to and attach to these grounds for views it leads to such and such a destiny in the next life.’ </p>
                
                    <p>He understands this, and what goes beyond this. And since he does not misapprehend that understanding, he has realized extinguishment within himself. </p>
                
                    <p>Having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape from feelings, the Realized One is freed through not grasping. </p>
                
                    <p>These are the principles—deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute—which the Realized One makes known after realizing them with his own insight.

                    <p>3.1.2. Partial Eternalism </p>
                
                    <p>There are some ascetics and brahmins who are partial eternalists, who assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal and partially not eternal on four grounds. </p>
                
                    <p>And what are the four grounds on which they rely? </p>
                
                    <p>There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, this cosmos contracts. </p>
                
                    <p>As the cosmos contracts, sentient beings are mostly headed for the realm of streaming radiance. </p>
                
                    <p>There they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the sky, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time. </p>
                
                    <p>There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, this cosmos expands. </p>
                
                    <p>As it expands an empty mansion of Brahmā appears. </p>
                
                    <p>Then a certain sentient being—due to the running out of their life-span or merit—passes away from that host of radiant deities and is reborn in that empty mansion of Brahmā. </p>
                
                    <p>There they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the sky, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time. </p>
                
                    <p>But after staying there all alone for a long time, they become dissatisfied and anxious: </p>
                
                    <p>‘Oh, if only another being would come to this state of existence.’ </p>
                
                    <p>Then other sentient beings—due to the running out of their life-span or merit—pass away from that host of radiant deities and are reborn in that empty mansion of Brahmā in company with that being. </p>
                
                    <p>There they too are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the sky, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time. </p>
                
                    <p>Now, the being who was reborn there first thinks: </p>
                
                    <p>‘I am Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, God Almighty, the Maker, the Creator, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born. </p>
                
                    <p>These beings were created by me! </p>
                
                    <p>Why is that? </p>
                
                    <p>Because first I thought: </p>
                
                    <p>“Oh, if only another being would come to this state of existence.” </p>
                
                    <p>Such was my heart’s wish, and then these creatures came to this state of existence.’ </p>
                
                    <p>And the beings who were reborn there later also think: </p>
                
                    <p>‘This must be Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, God Almighty, the Maker, the Creator, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born. </p>
                
                    <p>And we were created by him. </p>
                
                    <p>Why is that? </p>
                
                    <p>Because we see that he was reborn here first, and we arrived later.’ </p>
                
                    <p>And the being who was reborn first is more long-lived, beautiful, and illustrious than those who arrived later. </p>
                
                    <p>It’s possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existence. </p>
                
                    <p>Having done so, they go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
                
                    <p>By dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right application of mind, they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect that past life, but no further. </p>
                
                    <p>They say: </p>
                
                    <p>‘He who is Brahmā—the Great Brahmā, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, God Almighty, the Maker, the Creator, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born—by he we were created.

                    <p>We who were created by that Brahmā are impermanent, not lasting, short-lived, perishable, and have come to this state of existence.’ </p>
                
                    <p>This is the first ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal. </p>
                
                    <p>And what is the second ground on which they rely? </p>
                
                    <p>There are gods named ‘depraved by play.’ They spend too much time laughing, playing, and making merry. And in doing so, they lose their mindfulness, and they pass away from that host of gods. </p>

                    <p>‘The gods not depraved by play don’t spend too much time laughing, playing, and making merry. So they don’t lose their mindfulness, and don’t pass away from that host of gods. </p>
                
                    <p>They are permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, remaining the same for all eternity. </p>
                
                    <p>But we who were depraved by play spent too much time laughing, playing, and making merry. In doing so, we lost our mindfulness, and passed away from that host of gods. </p>

                    <p>And what is the third ground on which they rely? </p>
                
                    <p>There are gods named ‘malevolent’. They spend too much time gazing at each other, so they grow angry with each other, and their bodies and minds get tired. They pass away from that host of gods. </p>

                    <p>‘The gods who are not malevolent don’t spend too much time gazing at each other, so they don’t grow angry with each other, their bodies and minds don’t get tired, and they don’t pass away from that host of gods. </p>
                
                    <p>They are permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, remaining the same for all eternity. </p>
                
                    <p>But we who were malevolent spent too much time gazing at each other, we grew angry with each other, our bodies and minds got tired, and we passed away from that host of gods. </p>

                    <p>And what is the fourth ground on which they rely? </p>
                
                    <p>It’s when some ascetic or brahmin relies on logic and inquiry. They speak of what they have worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing their own perspective: </p>
                
                    <p>‘That which is called “the eye” or “the ear” or “the nose” or “the tongue” or “the body”: that self is impermanent, not lasting, transient, perishable. </p>
                
                    <p>That which is called “mind” or “sentience” or “consciousness”: that self is permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, remaining the same for all eternity.’ </p>
                
                    <p>This is the fourth ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal. </p>
                
                    <p>These are the four grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal and partially not eternal. </p>
                
                    <p>Any ascetics and brahmins who assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal and partially not eternal do so on one or other of these four grounds. Outside of this there is none. </p>
                
                    <p>The Realized One understands this: </p>
                
                    <p>‘If you hold on to and attach to these grounds for views it leads to such and such a destiny in the next life.’ </p>
                
                    <p>He understands this, and what goes beyond this. And since he does not misapprehend that understanding, he has realized extinguishment within himself. </p>
                
                    <p>Having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape from feelings, the Realized One is freed through not grasping. </p>
                
                    <p>These are the principles—deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute—which the Realized One makes known after realizing them with his own insight.

                    <p>There are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about size, and assert that the cosmos is finite or infinite on four grounds. </p>

                    <p>There are some ascetics and brahmins who are endless flip-floppers. Whenever they’re asked a question, they resort to verbal flip-flops and endless flip-flops on four grounds. </p>

                    <p>And what is the third ground on which they rely? </p>
                
                    <p>It’s when some ascetic or brahmin doesn’t truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillful. </p>
                
                    <p>They think: </p>

                    <p>Suppose I were to declare that something was skillful or unskillful. </p>
                
                    <p>There are clever ascetics and brahmins who are subtle, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters. You’d think they live to demolish convictions with their intellect. </p>
                
                    <p>They might pursue, press, and grill me about that. </p>
                
                    <p>I’d be stumped by such a grilling. </p>
                
                    <p>That would be stressful for me, </p>
                
                    <p>and that stress would be an obstacle.’ </p>

                    <p>And what is the fourth ground on which they rely? </p>
                
                    <p>It’s when some ascetic or brahmin is dull and stupid. </p>
                
                    <p>Because of that, whenever they’re asked a question, they resort to verbal flip-flops and endless flip-flops: </p>

                    <p>These are the four grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins who are flip-floppers resort to verbal flip-flops and endless flip-flops whenever they’re asked a question. </p>
                
                    <p>Any ascetics and brahmins who resort to verbal flip-flops and endless flip-flops do so on one or other of these four grounds. Outside of this there is none. </p>

                    <p>3.1.5. Doctrines of Origination by Chance </p>
                
                    <p>There are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about chance. They assert that the self and the cosmos arose by chance on two grounds. </p>
                
                    <p>And what are the two grounds on which they rely? </p>
                
                    <p>There are gods named ‘non-percipient beings’. </p>
                
                    <p>When perception arises they pass away from that host of gods. </p>
                
                    <p>It’s possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existence. </p>
                
                    <p>Having done so, they go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
                
                    <p>By dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right application of mind, they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect the arising of perception, but no further. </p>
                
                    <p>They say: </p>
                
                    <p>‘The self and the cosmos arose by chance. </p>
                
                    <p>Why is that? </p>
                
                    <p>Because formerly I didn’t exist. Now, having not existed, I’ve transformed into the state of existence.” </p>
                
                    <p>This is the first ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos arose by chance. </p>
                
                    <p>And what is the second ground on which they rely? </p>
                
                    <p>It’s when some ascetic or brahmin relies on logic and inquiry. </p>
                
                    <p>They speak of what they have worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing their own perspective: </p>
                
                    <p>‘The self and the cosmos arose by chance.’ </p>
                
                    <p>This is the second ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos arose by chance. </p>
                
                    <p>These are the two grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins who theorize about chance assert that the self and the cosmos arose by chance. </p>
                
                    <p>Any ascetics and brahmins who theorize about chance do so on one or other of these two grounds. Outside of this there is none. </p>
                
                    <p>The Realized One understands this … </p>
                
                    <p>And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. </p>
                
                    <p>These are the eighteen grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past assert various hypotheses concerning the past. </p>
                
                    <p>Any ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past do so on one or other of these eighteen grounds. Outside of this there is none. </p>
                
                    <p>The Realized One understands this: </p>
                
                    <p>‘If you hold on to and attach to these grounds for views it leads to such and such a destiny in the next life.’ </p>
                
                    <p>He understands this, and what goes beyond this. And since he does not misapprehend that understanding, he has realized extinguishment within himself. </p>
                
                    <p>Having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape from feelings, the Realized One is freed through not grasping. </p>
                
                    <p>These are the principles—deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute—which the Realized One makes known after realizing them with his own insight. And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. </p>

                    <p>That is how some assert the annihilation of an existing being. </p>
                
                    <p>But someone else says to them: </p>
                
                    <p>‘<em>That</em> self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. </p>
                
                    <p>But that’s not how <em>this</em> self becomes rightly annihilated. </p>
                
                    <p>There is another self that is divine, having form, sensual, consuming solid food. </p>
                
                    <p>You don’t know or see that. </p>

                    <p>There is another self which has gone totally beyond perceptions of form. With the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that “space is infinite”, it’s reborn in the dimension of infinite space. </p>

                    <p>3.2.5. Extinguishment in the Present Life </p>
                
                    <p>There are some ascetics and brahmins who speak of extinguishment in the present life. They assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life on five grounds. </p>
                
                    <p>And what are the five grounds on which they rely? </p>
                
                    <p>There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: </p>
                
                    <p>‘When this self amuses itself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, that’s how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life.’ </p>
                
                    <p>That is how some assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life. </p>
                
                    <p>But someone else says to them: </p>
                
                    <p>‘<em>That</em> self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. </p>
                
                    <p>But that’s not how <em>this</em> self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life. </p>
                
                    <p>Why is that? </p>
                
                    <p>Because sensual pleasures are impermanent, suffering, and perishable. Their decay and perishing give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. </p>
                
                    <p>Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, this self enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. That’s how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life.’ </p>
                
                    <p>That is how some assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life. </p>
                
                    <p>But someone else says to them: </p>
                
                    <p>‘<em>That</em> self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. </p>
                
                    <p>But that’s not how <em>this</em> self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life. </p>
                
                    <p>Why is that? </p>
                
                    <p>Because the placing of the mind and the keeping it connected there are coarse. </p>
                
                    <p>But when the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, this self enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. That’s how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life.’ </p>
                
                    <p>That is how some assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life. </p>
                
                    <p>But someone else says to them: </p>
                
                    <p>‘<em>That</em> self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. </p>
                
                    <p>But that’s not how <em>this</em> self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life. </p>
                
                    <p>Why is that? </p>
                
                    <p>Because the rapture and emotional excitement there are coarse. </p>
                
                    <p>But with the fading away of rapture, this self enters and remains in the third absorption, where it meditates with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, “Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss”. That’s how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life.’ </p>
                
                    <p>That is how some assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life. </p>
                
                    <p>But someone else says to them: </p>
                
                    <p>‘<em>That</em> self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. </p>
                
                    <p>But that’s not how <em>this</em> self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life. </p>
                
                    <p>Why is that? </p>
                
                    <p>Because the bliss and enjoyment there are coarse. </p>
                
                    <p>But giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, this self enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. That’s how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present life.’ </p>
                
                    <p>That is how some assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life. </p>
                
                    <p>These are the five grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life. </p>
                
                    <p>Any ascetics and brahmins who assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life do so on one or other of these five grounds. Outside of this there is none. </p>
                
                    <p>The Realized One understands this … </p>
                
                    <p>And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. </p>
                
                    <p>These are the forty-four grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the future assert various hypotheses concerning the future. </p>
                
                    <p>Any ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the future do so on one or other of these forty-four grounds. Outside of this there is none. </p>
                
                    <p>The Realized One understands this … </p>
                
                    <p>And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. </p>
                
                    <p>These are the sixty-two grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past and the future assert various hypotheses concerning the past and the future. </p>
                
                    <p>Any ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past or the future do so on one or other of these sixty-two grounds. Outside of this there is none. </p>
                
                    <p>The Realized One understands this: </p>
                
                    <p>‘If you hold on to and attach to these grounds for views it leads to such and such a destiny in the next life.’ </p>
                
                    <p>He understands this, and what goes beyond this. And since he does not misapprehend that understanding, he has realized extinguishment within himself. </p>
                
                    <p>Having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape from feelings, the Realized One is freed through not grasping. </p>
                
                    <p>These are the principles—deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute—which the Realized One makes known after realizing them with his own insight. And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things. </p>

                    <p>When those ascetics and brahmins theorize about the past and the future on these sixty-two grounds, these things are only the feeling of those who do not know or see, the anxiety and evasiveness of those under the sway of craving. </p>

                    <p>or that the self lives on after death in a neither percipient nor non-percipient form on eight grounds … </p>
                
                    <p>or they assert the annihilation of an existing being on seven grounds … </p>
                
                    <p>or they assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life on five grounds … </p>
                
                    <p>they theorize about the future on these forty-four grounds … </p>
                
                    <p>When those ascetics and brahmins theorize about the past and the future on these sixty-two grounds, that too is conditioned by contact. </p>
                
                    <p>4.3. Not Possible </p>
                
                    <p>Now, when those ascetics and brahmins theorize about the past and the future on these sixty-two grounds, it is not possible that they should experience these things without contact. </p>
                
                    <p>4.4. Dependent Origination </p>
                
                    <p>Now, when those ascetics and brahmins theorize about the past and the future on these sixty-two grounds, all of them experience this by repeated contact through the six fields of contact. Their feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. </p>
                
                    <p>5. The End of the Round </p>
                
                    <p>When a mendicant truly understands the six fields of contact’s origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape, they understand what lies beyond all these things. </p>
                
                    <p>All of these ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past or the future are trapped in the net of these sixty-two grounds, so that wherever they emerge they are caught and trapped in this very net. </p>
                
                    <p>Suppose a deft fisherman or his apprentice were to cast a fine-meshed net over a small pond. They’d think: ‘Any sizable creatures in this pond will be trapped in the net. Wherever they emerge they are caught and trapped in this very net.’ </p>
                
                    <p>In the same way, all of these ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past or the future are trapped in the net of these sixty-two grounds, so that wherever they emerge they are caught and trapped in this very net. </p>
                
                    <p>The Realized One’s body remains, but his conduit to rebirth has been cut off. </p>
                
                    <p>As long as his body remains he will be seen by gods and humans. </p>
                
                    <p>But when his body breaks up, after life has ended, gods and humans will see him no more. </p>
                
                    <p>When the stalk of a bunch of mangoes is cut, all the mangoes attached to the stalk will follow along. </p>
                
                    <p>In the same way, the Realized One’s body remains, but his conduit to rebirth has been cut off. </p>
                
                    <p>As long as his body remains he will be seen by gods and humans. </p>
                
                    <p>But when his body breaks up, after life has ended, gods and humans will see him no more.” </p>
                
                    <p>When he had spoken, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, </p>
                
                    <p>“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! What is the name of this exposition of the teaching?” </p>
                
                    <p>“Well, then, Ānanda, you may remember this exposition of the teaching as ‘The Net of Meaning’, or else ‘The Net of the Teaching’, or else ‘The Divine Net’, or else ‘The Net of Views’, or else ‘The Supreme Victory in Battle’.” </p>
                
                    <p>That is what the Buddha said. </p>
                
                    <p>Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said. </p>
                
                    <p>And while this discourse was being spoken, the galaxy shook. </p>
