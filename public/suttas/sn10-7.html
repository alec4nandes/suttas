                    <p>1. With Indaka </p>
                
                    <p>With Punabbasu </p>
                
                    <p>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>
                
                    <p>Now at that time the Buddha was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk about extinguishment. </p>
                
                    <p>And those mendicants were paying attention, applying the mind, concentrating wholeheartedly, and actively listening. </p>
                
                    <p>Then the native spirit Punabbasu’s Mother soothed her little children, saying: </p>
                
                    <p>“Hush, little Uttarā! </p>
                
                    <p>Hush, Punabbasu! </p>
                
                    <p>For I want to listen to the teaching </p>
                
                    <p>of the Teacher, the supreme Buddha. </p>
                
                    <p>Since the Blessed One spoke of extinguishment, </p>
                
                    <p>the release from all ties, </p>
                
                    <p>I have a lasting love </p>
                
                    <p>for this teaching. </p>
                
                    <p>In this world, your own child is dear; </p>
                
                    <p>in this world, your own husband is dear; </p>
                
                    <p>but even greater than that is my love </p>
                
                    <p>for this teaching’s quest. </p>
                
                    <p>For neither son nor husband, </p>
                
                    <p>dear as they are, can free you from suffering; </p>
                
                    <p>as listening to the true teaching </p>
                
                    <p>frees living creatures from suffering. </p>
                
                    <p>In this world mired in suffering, </p>
                
                    <p>fettered by old age and death, </p>
                
                    <p>I want to listen to the teaching </p>
                
                    <p>that the Buddha awakened to, </p>
                
                    <p>which frees you from old age and death. </p>
                
                    <p>So hush, Punabbasu!” </p>
                
                    <p>“Mom, I’m not speaking, </p>
                
                    <p>and Uttarā is silent, too. </p>
                
                    <p>Focus just on the teaching, </p>
                
                    <p>for it’s nice to listen to the true teaching. </p>
                
                    <p>And it’s because we haven’t understood the teaching </p>
                
                    <p>that we live in suffering, Mom. </p>
                
                    <p>He is a beacon for those who are lost </p>
                
                    <p>among gods and humans. </p>
                
                    <p>The Buddha, bearing his final body, </p>
                
                    <p>the Clear-eyed One teaches Dhamma.” </p>
                
                    <p>“It’s good that my child’s so astute, </p>
                
                    <p>this child I bore and suckled! </p>
                
                    <p>My child loves the pure teaching </p>
                
                    <p>of the supreme Buddha. </p>
                
                    <p>Punabbasu, may you be happy! </p>
                
                    <p>Today, I rise. </p>
                
                    <p>Hear me too, Uttarā: </p>
                
                    <p>I have seen the noble truths!” </p>
